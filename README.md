# Missing Data Multiple Imputation for Tabular Q-Learning in Online RL
This repo accompanies the paper "Missing Data Multiple Imputation for Tabular Q-Learning in Online RL" written for Susan Murphy's [Stat 234](https://people.seas.harvard.edu/~samurphy/teaching/stat234spring2024/syllabus.htm)  class at Harvard in Spring 2024.

Within the `src` directory:

* `GridWorldHelpers` contains functions for setting up and visualizing the environment, taking an action in that environment, generating the missingness under various mechanisms, and doing Q learning
* `GridWorldImputers` contains functions for implementing MI
* `SimulationHelpers` contains functions that aid in running our simulations
* `GridWorldTests` contains some tests of various functions in the above scripts
